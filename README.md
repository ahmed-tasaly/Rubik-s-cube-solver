# Rubik's cube solver
Android app that solves the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube.
It scans the faces using OpenCV, then it solves the cube in less than 26 moves (with Kociemba's algorithm), and lastly it shows the calculated moves in a 3D reproduction of the cube. 
It's possible to see each move and spin the cube.
### Requisites
The app only work's with a 3x3x3 cube, with colors red, blue, green, orange, yellow and white.

# Design
I've imagined to redesign the app for another university project (Software Engineering course).
